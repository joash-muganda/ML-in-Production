# Movie Rating Sentiment Analysis - MLOps Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing an end-to-end machine learning operations (MLOps) pipeline for a movie rating sentiment analysis model. The goal is to demonstrate Level 4 ML Maturity, which includes advanced MLOps capabilities such as continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), automated deployment, metrics monitoring, and drift detection and mitigation.
